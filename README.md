## Overview

This project includes tests for a web application using Playwright. It tests various functionalities such as login, product selection, checkout, and contact form submission. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (installed as a dev dependency)
- Git (for version control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`, including Playwright.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, 
First you have to modify data files as you want. 
after that, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

If you want to run a specific test file, for example, `loginTest.spec.js`, you can use:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/loginTest.spec.js
```

This will run only the `loginTest.spec.js` test file.

### Run Specific Tests

You can also use `testMatch` in your `playwright.config.js` to specify which test files to run.

```javascript
testMatch: [
  'tests/signupTest.spec.js',
  'tests/loginTest.spec.js',
  'tests/categoryTest.spec.js',
  'tests/addtoCartTest.spec.js',
  'tests/checkoutAndpaymentTest.spec.js',
  'tests/contactUs.spec.js'
],
```

## Test Reporting

Playwright generates a detailed HTML report after the tests are run. To view the last test report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

This will open the HTML report showing the test results.

## Directory Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
project/
├── tests/
│   ├── signupTest.spec.js                    # Signup tests
│   ├── loginTest.spec.js                     # Login tests
│   ├── categoryTest.spec.js                  # Category selection tests
│   ├── addtoCartTest.spec.js                 # Product selection tests
│   ├── checkoutAndpaymentTest.spec.js        # Checkout tests
│   ├── contactUs.spec.js                     # Contact Us tests
├── .gitignore                                # Git ignore file
├── package.json                              # Project dependencies and scripts

└── README.md                                 # Project readme
```

### Explanation of the Directory Structure:
- **tests/**: Contains all your test files. Each test file corresponds to a feature of the application being tested.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.
- **package.json**: Contains all project dependencies and scripts for running tests.
- **playwright.config.js**: Playwright configuration file where settings like `baseURL`, headless mode, retries, and other configurations are defined.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides documentation for setting up and running the project.

## Configuration

The Playwright configuration is located in the `playwright.config.js` file. It includes the following settings:

- **baseURL**: The base URL for the application being tested, pulled from the `.env` file (or set to a default value).
- **headless**: Whether to run tests in headless mode. This is set to `false` for easier debugging.
- **screenshot**: Configured to capture screenshots on test failures.
- **trace**: Trace collection is enabled on the first retry, which helps you debug issues.
